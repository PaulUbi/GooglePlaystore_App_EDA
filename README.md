# GooglePlaystore_App_EDA
- Utilized Python to analyze a massive dataset of over 2 million applications on the Google Play Store.
- Leveraging this data, I developed a sophisticated machine learning model capable of accurately predicting potential user ratings for these applications. Thus assisting Google Play Store administrators to identify low-performing applications and improve the overall user experience on the platform.
- Tools: Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Sklearn.
